%% Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 2: Logistic Regression
%
%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the second part
%  of the exercise which covers regularization with logistic regression.
%
%  You will need to complete the following functions in this exericse:
%
%     sigmoid.m
%     costFunction.m
%     predict.m
%     costFunctionReg.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
%

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

%% Load Data
%  The first two columns contains the exam scores and the third column
%  contains the label.

data = load('ex2data2.txt');
X = data(:, [1, 2]); y = data(:, 3);

%plotData(X, y);

% Put some labels 
%hold on;

% Labels and Legend
%xlabel('Microchip Test 1')
%ylabel('Microchip Test 2')

% Specified in plot order
%legend('y = 1', 'y = 0')
%hold off;


%% =========== Part 1: Regularized Logistic Regression ============
%  In this part, you are given a dataset with data points that are not
%  linearly separable. However, you would still like to use logistic 
%  regression to classify the data points. 
%
%  To do so, you introduce more features to use -- in particular, you add
%  polynomial features to our data matrix (similar to polynomial
%  regression).
%

% Add Polynomial Features

% Note that mapFeature also adds a column of ones for us, so the intercept
% term is handled
X = mapFeature(X(:,1), X(:,2));

% Initialize fitting parameters
initial_theta = zeros(size(X, 2), 1);

% Set regularization parameter lambda to 1
lambda = 1;

% Compute and display initial cost and gradient for regularized logistic
% regression
[cost, grad] = costFunctionReg(initial_theta, X, y, lambda);

fprintf('Cost at initial theta (zeros): %f\n', cost);
grad

[cost, grad] = lrCostFunction(initial_theta, X, y, lambda);

fprintf('Cost at initial theta (zeros): %f\n', cost);
grad
%fprintf('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n');
%pause;
